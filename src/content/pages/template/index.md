# Welcome to the new content template

For starters, do not rename the files in this duplicated directory. Also, if you didn't duplicate the directory and you are editing inside the template, STOP! Revert changes and start over.

**Update the following files for your new content:**

* `./src/App.js`
* `./src/content/docs.js`
* `./src/components/side-nav/index.js`

Lastly, when you are up and running, delete this content and add your own!
