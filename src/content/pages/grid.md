## Overview

The grid is a responsive, mobile first, fluid system that scales 12 columns across the viewport of a device.  The grid is based on a 16 pixel uniform spacing structure that's used to appropriately arrange content into aligned columns and rows.

## Anatomy

## Breakpoints

Columns, gutters, and margins scale as the device and viewport increases or decreases.  Different breakpoints require either a fixed or fluid responsive grid.

* **Fluid grid:** A grid built using columns that are considered flexible.  When the screen size is changed, the widths of these columns will adjust proportionally.
* **Fixed grid:** A grid built with columns that have a defined width.  When the screen size is changed, the columns do not change their width.
