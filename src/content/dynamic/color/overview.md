The colors within our digital experiences differs from the physical materials of our brand. What may appear vibrant on paper may seem dull and uninspired on a glowing screen. As a result, the colors we use within our digital experiences are adjusted to create a more vibrant and inspirational experiences for our guests. In addition to our core digital brand colors, an extended palette has been created for more personality expression within our experiences by adding warmth, deeper connection, and more human characteristics to our digital brand.

## Reserve the use of blue

Midnight is our primary brand color, and should be used sparingly to avoid overuseâ€”giving more prominence to the Alaska Airlines brand.

**Do**

* Reserve Midnight for branded elements that specifically reference or enhance the Alaska Airlines logo or brand
* Consider using our digital personality colors instead of Midnight Blue to show expression within your designs

**Don't**

* Don't use Midnight for heading text, unless it's been approved for a specific marketing campaign
* Don't use Midnight as interaction color. Instead, consider using `color-ui-default`
* Don't blue-wash the guest experience for the sake of branding
