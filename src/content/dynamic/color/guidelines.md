## Design guidelines

### Reserve the use of blue

Midnight is our primary brand color, and should be used sparingly to avoid overuseâ€”giving more prominence to the Alaska Airlines brand.

**Do**

* Reserve Midnight for branded elements that specifically reference or enhance the Alaska Airlines logo or brand
* Consider using our digital personality colors instead of Midnight Blue to show expression within your designs

**Don't**

* Don't use Midnight for heading text, unless it's been approved for a specific marketing campaign
* Don't use Midnight as interaction color. Instead, consider using `color-ui-default`
* Don't blue-wash the guest experience for the sake of branding
