### Our typeface

The Auro Design System uses AS Circular, a custom typeface for all copy for web, mobile, and kiosks. Structured yet simple, our font ensures clarity and readability. Using three distinct lighter-weights, we maintain a level consistency within our content hierarchy.

### Headings

Headings provide hierarchy and context.  Available heading styles include:

### Display

Use display type for large stylistic headlines and marketing campaign headlines. Because display is a lighter weight, it should not be used to convey need-to-know information.

### Body

#### LG

Use LG to define hierarchy without displaying it prominently in your design.
Applications include lead-in copy, pull-quotes, and sub-headings.

#### Default

Default is our baseline type. Use Default for body text.
Applications include paragraphs, lists, descriptions, and links.

#### SM

Use SM as a variant of our default size to allow for more complex compositions.
Applications include form labels, secondary information, and helper text.

#### XS

Limit XS to legal copy.
Applications include terms and conditions of an on-screen product or offering.

## Behavior

### On light/on dark

Two modes define our type's color.

* On-light: primary site environment
* On-dark: copy on dark photography; further usage to be defined.

Additional details about the usage of typography on light or dark backgrounds can be found within [color usage](/core/color) page.

### Reverse weight scale

Our heading weights are built to maintain open, airy layouts while supporting a deep hierarchy. Starting from our smallest heading (300), weight is set at medium and progressively decreases through book and onwards to our largest type (display) set at light.

### Fallback font

If the primary font is unavailable or cannot be loaded on a guest's device, our products will automatically fall back to `Helvetica Neue` or `Helvetica`.  Apple iOS devices will fall back to `SF Pro`, while Android products will fall back to `Roboto` by default.
