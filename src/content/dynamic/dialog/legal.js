        <p>This is the main Privacy Notice for the Alaska Air Group airlines: Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Under applicable law, Alaska Airlines, Inc. ("Alaska") is considered the "data controller" of the personal data these companies handle under this Privacy Notice. In other words, Alaska is responsible for deciding how these companies collect, use and disclose this data. Alaska's contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Notice.</p>

        <auro-header level="2" display="500">WHAT THIS PRIVACY NOTICE COVERS</auro-header>
        <p>This Privacy Notice applies to the Alaska websites and apps that link to this Privacy Notice, as well as to Alaska's own privacy practices in connection with our services. For that reason, this Privacy Notice does not cover actions of third parties related to our services. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you arrange travel on our airlines through third parties (such as travel agents, other airlines, search engines and travel websites) those third parties' own privacy policies apply to their own handling of all the personal data they collect, and Alaska will handle the personal data that Alaska receives from them or you under this Privacy Notice.</li>
          <li>Alaska Mileage Plan™-branded credit cards and related financial products are provided by Bank of America (for U.S. residents) and The Toronto-Dominion Bank (MBNA, for Canadian residents). Their handling of personal data (including to assess your application and administer the card) is subject to their own privacy policies. When they share personal data with us (such as to coordinate eligibility for Mileage Plan™ miles based on card usage), we handle that limited data pursuant to this Privacy Notice.</li>
          <li>This Privacy Notice does not cover our human resources activities, other than our online Careers pages that collect data for recruiting purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <auro-header level="2" display="500">WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?</auro-header>
        <p>"Personal data" means information about a person that can be linked to that person. For example, an identifiable individual's email address, travel record and credit card number are personal data.</p>

        <auro-header level="2" display="500">HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA</auro-header>
        <p>We collect personal data at the airport (such as at our ticket counters and kiosks) and through other online or offline channels, such as our websites, apps, inflight entertainment systems, and call centers. We also receive personal data collected by our affiliates, partners, loyalty program participants, service providers, travel agents, other airlines, and others who are involved in your travel experience, as well as other third parties such as companies that provide demographic information we use to supplement information to personalize your experience and our marketing and advertising. We may combine the personal data we receive from any of these sources.</p>
