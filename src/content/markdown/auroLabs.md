## Create an AuroLab repo

1. Auro Admin will be given access to install security tokens to publish npm to `@aurolabs/` npm org
1. These custom elements can be used with Alaska apps and will go through a refinement process prior to publishing to the official `@auro/` namespace
1. Creators are encouraged to produce demo pages and publish them on a service such as `surge.sh` for reference
