# Auro style sheet

This style sheet is intended for E-commerce use, and supplements the style sheet put out by Marketing. Contact your favorite UX writer if you have any questions.

For **one**world style guidelines, see Marketing’s style sheet.

Refer to the AP Style Guide for any broader questions about style and usage.

## Accessibility

* Never do generic form/field errors (e.g., “this field is required”); describe the field in the error (“the first name field is required”)
* Make link text descriptive — describe what it does (don’t use “learn more”)

## Alert types

**NOTE:** Usage guidelines need to be fleshed out:

* notification (blue)
* success (green)
* minor error/warning (orange)
* stopper error/cancellation (red)
* advisory (pale orange)

See the Auro component guidelines for more information.

## Contractions

Contractions are OK. They’re fine. Don’t be afraid of them. They’re a good way to lighten up the copy and make it more conversational.

## Currency

Display full currency amounts, including the decimal column; this inspires trust and transparency in our pricing. For example:

* $17.00 (display the decimal column, even for whole dollar amounts)
* $16.99 (note no rounding up to $17.00)
For receipts, statements, cost/fee breakdowns, etc., try to line up the decimal points.

**Note:** It's OK *not* to show cents on the flight matrix page.

## Gender

Gender is always neutral. Never use “he” or “she;” use “they” instead.

## Oxford comma

We like it. It helps separate individual items in a series, delineate each item as a separate entity, and encourage a bit of parallelism in your syntax.

## Time

Display times as follows:

* 7:15 am (note no leading zero)
* 10:15 pm

## Specific terms

account—use instead of “My Account”; you can use “Alaska account” instead if more clarity is needed
account wallet—use to indicate or clarify the relationship between “account” and “wallet” (i.e,. the wallet is part of the account, not the other way ‘round)

bag drop—use instead of “baggage drop” or “baggage counter,” etc. (note lc)

cancel (try to avoid unless you’re talking about canceled reservations; use “go back” instead)
canceled (one “l’)
cancellation (two “l’s”)
check in (v)
check-in (n, adj)
COVID-19—try to avoid using this term if you can (it’s big and scary and hopefully will be dated someday)
credit card (note lc)
customer service agent (note lc)

E-commerce—that’s how you capitalize and hyphenate it, but don’t use this term in guest-facing copy
