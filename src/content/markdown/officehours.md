# Auro office hours

The Auro team, like any other team, wants to provide the best support possible. But for that to happen, we need to allow time to be focused and to reduce context switching.

This is where Office Hours come in. During these hours Auro team members will be willing and able to respond to random conversations and requests. But outside these hours, we ask for your patience.

## What are Auro's office hours?

<!-- Simply put, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 1pm - 4pm Pacific time. Wednesday's are reserved for team planning days. -->

Office hours will vary between team members and contributors. Be sure to see the table below for hours per person.

During office hours, Auro team members will not schedule team meetings nor block their calendars. These slots are available on a 1st come, 1st serve basis.


## 1:1 support with Auro

Questions, code issues or simple curiosity, we **recommend** submitting a [Github support ticket](/component-status) with the specific repo your issues relates prior requesting 1:1 time.

For internal Alaska users, there is a [Teams channel for Auro](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a5df2ca021a6548c4af54256bbc737129%40thread.skype/Auro%2520(public)?groupId=3a6a4783-59c6-496a-a20c-ab306461a894&tenantId=0f44c5d4-42b0-45c2-bf55-d0fea8430d33). Please reserve this for general support where other users may respond. It is not recommended for larger architectural discussions or platform issues where the attention of an Auro team member is required.

Auro team members may not engage in conversation in Teams outside the designated office hours.

## Schedule a time to talk

Sometimes documentation or setup instructions simply aren't enough. Please see the list of Auro team members with instructions as how to best schedule time with them.
