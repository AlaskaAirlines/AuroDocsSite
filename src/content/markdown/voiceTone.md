# Voice and tone guidelines

Alaska's voice is consistent throughout the experience; adapt the tone as needed to fit the situation and context.

## Writing for UX

UX writing is a form of technical poetry. You must work within the space and attention constraints of the medium. Language, usage, and rhythm all matter.

Keep the tone and language conversational and welcoming, but work to eliminate any unnecessary fat. Think about the inverted pyramid: front-load the important part of your message, where guests are most likely to read it.

The shape and mass of text matters, too: long paragraphs can be intimidating and difficult to parse.

> Think about the F-shaped scanning pattern: the longer the passage, the less likely people are to read it to the end.

* Where possible, try distilling and editing down longer sections into a series of self-contained bullet points.
* Remember that one bullet point by itself is a bit sad and lonely, but don't add more bullets just for the sake of adding bullets.

When in doubt, try reading your text aloud. If it's awkward to recite, it's probably awkward to parse, too.

Iterate, iterate, iterate. Try different phrasing and different constructions. Try different tones. Try reordering clauses or removing adjectives. Edit things down—without removing or changing the meaning/intent, and without getting so terse that the passage comes off as abrupt or impolite. In short, play around with it.

## Voice

Alaska's voice conveys competence, confidence, and transparency.

* Genuine: honest, sincere
* Expressive: soulful, elegant, considered
* Thoughtful: curious, trusted, warm
* Optimistic: hopeful, progressive, energetic
* Engaging: vibrant, open, gracious

Think about “wink” and “wow” moments—opportunities to be more brand-forward where appropriate.

## Tone

Tone varies throughout the user journey. Think about where guests are in their journey—and their potential emotional state—and match the tone to the moment.

### Get inspired phase

Alaska's voice can be subtly playful and clever. During the "get inspired" phase, you can take some editorial risks with the copy—i.e., you can be more brand-forward. Try to coordinate   with Marketing to sync UI content with any campaigns in progress.

### Shopping/purchase phase

Use direct, clear language for descriptive text, calls to action (buttons and text links), error messages, and payment options. Work with a designer to ensure that information layout is clear and easy to scan/parse.

Celebratory or fun moments—such as ordering food items, or opting for an upsell—can be more brand-forward. Here's an opportunity to inject a little fun into the prose, to remind guests who we are.

### Day-of-travel phase

For day-of-travel communications, think of the voice of one of our pilots: confident, competent, clear, transparent, informative. This is wayfinding text: helping guests through the check-in process and to the correct gate in time for their flight, and providing clear direction on what to do if things go awry.

The tone at this point in the guest journey should convey nothing but information, clarity, and direction—especially during disruptions.  Get them where they need to go, get straight to the point with critical communications, and provide clear information, direction, and options for action.

## Specific language/usage guidelines

### CTAs

CTAs use sentence case. A button or link should convey its function, and clearly communicate what is about to happen. Use clear action words, and be descriptive.

> In airline-speak, the word "cancel" is potentially radioactive; it might lead guests to think they're canceling their reservation! Try to avoid the [ OK ] [ Cancel ]  convention wherever possible.

### Error messages

These aren’t “ooh” or “aah” moments; these are “oh” moments. Get straight to the point, especially with critical errors, and include a corrective action wherever possible.

Avoid jargon or programmer-speak in error messages. Most guests don't know what a "missing operand" is—and wouldn't know what to do if they encountered one.

Work with your developers to hone the message to the situation; if you're unable to write a clear error statement or define corrective action or mitigation, chances are the underlying code needs some attention, too.

### Push notifications

These aren’t “ooh” or “aah” moments; these are potentially “oh shit” moments. Again, get straight to the point, and include direction where relevant.

Make sure push notifications are distinct from each other. For example, a flight delay notification should say it's a flight delay notification; a back-on-time notification should explicitly say a flight is back on time.

### Use sentence case in headings.

* Where: Headlines, CTA’s (Fab, button, text link, etc)
* Use Title Case for proper nouns only

### Use ending punctuation for full sentences only.

### Avoid use of idioms.

Idioms don't work so well for non-native speakers, and might even be insulting for folks with a different cultural background. Try to avoid them.
