# Auro Design System Basic Site

This repo is for the maangement of a basic 'sticker sheet' representaiton of Auro Design System elements in preperation for building the Auro Design System public web site.

## Run site locally

* `npm run copyFiles` copies over the fonts
* `npm run buildIcons` builds the icon library
* `npm start` starts the dev server
* `npm run dev` does all three actions together.

## Add new content

Adding content means a few different things. Here are some instructions for various types.

### Local markdown doc

An internal markdown doc means that the content is in the form of markdown and the file is located locally in this project.

**To crate a new document:**

* Find the directory `./src/content/pages/template`
* Duplicate the directory with the name of your new content
* No need to change file names
* In the markdown doc, review instructions and get to work!
